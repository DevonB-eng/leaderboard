# leaderboard

**Idea** - app that monitors a friend group's screentime and posts a screentime leaderboard at the end of each day.

## Implementation

- user signs in with email/password (no google auth because not necessary)
- flutter allows for development of both ios and android (currently android only)
- firestone database allows for real time updating and group creation
- ability to add or remove apps to "bad apps" list per group decision

## Features

- unlimitied sized groups
- real time screentime leaderboard displayed for each group (only displaying "bad" apps: social medias & such)
- ability to add or remove apps to "bad apps" list per group decision
